## About ##

tagTodo is a todo list manager.  Unlike a traditional To Do list, it manages todo lists in a more organized way, allowing you to tag items with tags that give you meta information about an item.  This is an attempt to be a more logical way to organize your todo lists, allowing you to look only at only the relevant portion of your todo list (e.g. "Work", and due in 5 hours).
