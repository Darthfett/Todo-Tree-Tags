# Todo Tree Tags #

## About ##

Todo Tree Tags is a todo list manager.  It allows you to create a hierarchy of tags to more easily manage a todo list.  You can filter tags and text to see only relevant todos items.
 
Initially, Todo Tree Tags will be a native Windows 7 Phone application.  When the project matures more, it will eventually be moved to a webservice, so that todo items can be synced across multiple devices.
